Webpage conversion and generation script experiments

CSS Desaturation


It's still fresh out of my mind but I've done enough of a proof of concept to check this in.

After rethinking the hex conversion, I realized I over simplified and the algorithm needs to be 
rethought for desaturation as currently #f00, #0f0, #00f become white.

I've created a color test image for the test case.
